# Bucket list (React, Redux, Typescript)
This project is a bucket list with the ability to add new items for which the image and description is generated by open AI. The design was not the main goal, so it was done with the help of bootstrap without adaptive. This project implemented local storage using Redux Persist. Test coverage 99%. To simulate requests, actions are wrapped in a stupid function.
[You can veiw it on Vercel](https://bucket-list-one.vercel.app/)
